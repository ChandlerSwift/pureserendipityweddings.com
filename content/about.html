<h2>Serendipity</h2>
<p>[noun] &nbsp; Finding something beautiful without looking for it.</p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Pure Serendipity is a Minnesota-based company that specializes in event
design, wedding planning, and wedding coordination. Pure Serendipity is owned
and operated by Käthe and Katie. </p>
<p>Pure Serendipity is the result of a fourth grade seating assignment that
bloomed into a lifetime friendship. </p>
<p>One might say our bond formed through our creative imaginations. Whether it
was losing ourselves in the world of the Trixie Belden book series and other 4th
grade reading assignments, or creating art with whatever media we could get our
hands on. You could find us reading, writing, drawing, lettering, and more.</p>
<p>Our experience in event planning began early as well. As 6th graders, we
threw an all-ages, cocktail attire Oscars party. With a budget that paled in
comparison to the Academy’s, our party was complete with a red (towel) carpet,
ball gowns, shrimp cocktails, and chocolate Oscar awards. While no A-listers
were in attendance, we were pretty proud to host a party for 50 of our families’
closest friends.</p>
<p>We got engaged within a week of each other, which channeled that creative
energy into everything “wedding”. On a road trip together, we talked about how
much we truly loved wedding planning and would miss it once married. It was on
that car ride that we realized there was a way for us to continue following our
passion and we formed the idea of Pure Serendipity.</p>
<p>Serendipitous is a word that could be used to describe the lifelong
friendship we found as fourth graders or the way in which our passion project,
this business, came to be. Please reach out if you are interested in having two
BFFs who truly love everything related to weddings help you create and manage
your dream day. There is so much beauty in a wedding day, let us handle the
details so you can fully enjoy every moment.</p>
<p>Just like your love story, your wedding should feel like Pure
Serendipity.</p>

<img src="/katherine-sm.jpg" class="headshot">
<!--
<p>Somewhere around age 10 or 11, Käthe started a binder called “Just Thoughts.”
In it, she compiled pages of ideas for venues, dresses, shoes, decor, and
seating arrangements for weddings in every season and every location she could
dream of. This kicked off her love for the planning and design aspect of
weddings. </p>
<p>Around the same time, Käthe also started working on hand lettering. In the
early years, it looked like writing the alphabet in different fonts or mimicking
her teachers’ handwriting. Later on, it resulted in elaborate notes for college
classes. Now, her lettering can be found on the custom stationery offered
through Pure Serendipity. </p>
<p>Having worked in food service, customer service, and as a dance teacher,
Käthe also discovered her passion for helping others find creative solutions for
whatever situation may arise. Now, she continues to find joy in organizing,
problem solving, details, and of course, weddings! </p>
<p>When she’s not day-dreaming about weddings or working on lettering for
stationery, Käthe loves spending time with dogs (and can’t wait to have her
own), vision boarding, baking delicious treats, and listening to podcasts. </p>
